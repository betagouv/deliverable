# Deliverable

What's the most annoying obligation in a developer life other than accounting?

Writing your project deliverables!

You can now de-li-ver (ha-ha-ha) yourself by automatizing this task with **Deliverable**, a CLI tool that does (most of)
the job for you!

**Deliverable** parses either your fancy Github release descriptions, or your pull request subjects, or your
well-written commit messages (which you should ALWAYS have!) from your main branch to generate a well-formatted Markdown
document.

And if you don't have any of those, maybe you should start improving your continuous development practices 😉.
